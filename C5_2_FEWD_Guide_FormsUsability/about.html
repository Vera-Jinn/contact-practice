					<H3>Organized by Family, Friends & Community</H3>

					<p>The Bayside Heights Residences Craft Market Event is more than a gathering of
						artists and craft enthusiasts; it is a manifestation of love, respect, and
						empowerment organized by those closest to the residents of Bayside Heights
						Residences - their family, friends, and community members.
					</p>
					<h3>Who We Are</h3>
					<p>We are a passionate not-for-profit group of volunteers united by a shared belief in
						the importance of recognizing and nurturing the independence, creativity, and
						valuable contributions of our seniors. Comprised of family members, friends, and
						fellow community members, our team understands the essence of the Bayside
						Heights community and is dedicated to creating platforms where our older citizens
						can shine.</p>
					<h3>Our Mission</h3>
					<p>Our mission extends beyond organizing a craft market. We aim to celebrate the
						wisdom, skills, and artistry of the seniors at Bayside Heights Residences and local
						artists, presenting them not as beneficiaries, but as the very heart and soul of our
						community</p>
